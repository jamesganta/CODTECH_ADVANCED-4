# Overview of the Project

  Recommendation Systems

Definition: Recommendation Systems are algorithms that suggest items (products, movies, music, news, etc.) to users based on their past behavior, preferences, and the behavior of similar users.
Types:
Collaborative Filtering:
User-Based: Recommends items liked by similar users.
Item-Based: Recommends items similar to those a user has liked in the past.
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends items with similar characteristics to those a user has liked in the past.
Hybrid: Combines multiple approaches (e.g., collaborative and content-based).
Matrix Factorization: Decomposes the user-item matrix into two lower-dimensional matrices, capturing latent factors (e.g., user preferences, item attributes).
Instructions: Build a Recommendation System

Data Collection and Preparation:

Gather a dataset containing user-item interactions (e.g., ratings, purchases, views).
Clean the data by handling missing values, removing outliers, and transforming data as needed.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Choose a Technique:

Collaborative Filtering:
User-Based: Calculate similarity between users (e.g., using cosine similarity, Pearson correlation).
Item-Based: Calculate similarity between items (e.g., using cosine similarity, adjusted cosine similarity).
Matrix Factorization:
Use algorithms like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Alternating Least Squares (ALS), or Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF).
Model Training:

Train the chosen model on the training data.
Tune hyperparameters (e.g., number of latent factors, regularization parameters) to optimize performance.
Generate Recommendations:

Use the trained model to generate recommendations for users in the test set.
For new users, consider techniques like cold-start recommendations (e.g., recommending popular items).
Evaluation:

Use appropriate metrics to evaluate the performance of the recommendation system:
Accuracy Metrics:
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Ranking Metrics:
Precision, Recall, F1-score
Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)
Coverage: Measures the proportion of items that can be recommended.
Novelty: Measures the extent to which recommendations are new and unexpected.
Diversity: Measures the variety of items recommended.
